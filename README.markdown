Go in a Django World
====================

Once you've got the base Go toolchain installed, you can run this presentation
and play with the live code samples:

```
go get code.google.com/p/go.talks/present
# switch to this directory
present -http="localhost:8080"
# browse to localhost:8080
```

You'll lose the interactive code snippets, but you can also read a PDF
version on
[SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/akshayjshah/go-in-a-django-world).
